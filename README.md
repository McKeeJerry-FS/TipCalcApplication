# TipCalcApplication

The Tip Calculator Application was a collaboartion assignmnet completed by David Griffin, Katina Nicholas, and Jerry McKee Jr. for the Tech Talent South Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a JavaScript application that would allow you to figure out the tip of a total check split amonst the people included on the check. 

The functionality was worked on by David Griffin with additions added by Jerry McKee Jr and Katina Nicholas, while the design was worked on by Katina Nicholas with additions made by David Griffin. The overall application was refined into a web application later by Jerry McKee Jr. with contributions added by the team.

This application was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and BootStrap 5 on Visual Studio Code and now sits among three repos on GitHub. The Code can be found at these GitHub links:
